### Welcome to my Github! 👋

Hi, I'm Spencer! I'm a full stack software engineer and recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara who is seeking to work on meaningful, cutting-edge technology with great people. Aside from developing software, I also have experience in marketing, finance and e-commerce and would be excited to bring my diverse experiences to a dynamic team.
